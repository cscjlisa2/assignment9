I deployed my Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP honeypot as specified in the instructions.  

The biggest issue I had with this project was that my initial mhn-admin vm was disconnected or down, and I had to constantly redownload and run the script to make this assignment work.  

After I left it running for 30 minutes, I had three attacks.  They all attacked Port 3389.  There were no malware samples during that time I left it running.  

I have attacked the .json file as instructed to.
